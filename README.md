# Technical Requirements

*Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) -- ideally a user model and one that represents the main functional idea for your app

*Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow

*Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape.

*Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

*Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data

*Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process

*Have semantically clean HTML and CSS

*Be deployed online and accessible to the public


# Progress Pictures:

# Day 1
I drew out a rough draft of what I wanted my views to look like, how I wanted to plan my tables, and read into how the makeup API works. I started working on some basic styling and getting authentication up and running.

# Day 2
I finished getting authentication running. I did a little more light styling and found images to be used later. I started working on getting the search information from my form and submitting it to my API.

# Day 3
Finished selecting what API data I wanted to keep and work with. Started working on saving products to the vanity.

# Day 4
Got products to save to the products table and displayed products in the various vanity sections and created delete functionality.

# Day 5
Figured out how to send search term information to results view and got search term functionality working, reguardless of case. Did some styling work.

# Technologies Used

* Express
* Node.js
* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap

# Bumps in the Road

I struggled a lot with the Node/Express concepts. I found out I had been working off a misconception and once that was cleared up it made things a lot easier. I found a lot of the things that I had done before couldn't be implemented in the same ways but I was eventually able to work around that and figure out how to make it work.

# Next Steps

*Style

*Use second API to allow for searches by barcode
