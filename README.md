Project 2

# Technical Requirements

# Progress Pictures:

# Day 1
I drew out a rough draft of what I wanted my views to look like, how I wanted to plan my tables, and read into how the makeup API works. I started working on some basic styling and getting authentication up and running.

# Day 2
I finished getting authentication running. I did a little more light styling and found images to be used later. I started working on getting the search information from my form and submitting it to my API.

# Day 3

# Technologies Used

* Express
* Node & Java Script & jQuery
* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap

# Bumps in the Road

I struggled a lot with the Node/Express concepts. Working my recently developed skills into it was difficult for me. I found a lot of the things that I had done before didn't work now.
