# Progress Pictures:

# Day 1
I drew out a rough draft of what I wanted my views to look like, how I wanted to plan my tables, and read into how the makeup API works. I started working on some basic styling and getting authentication up and running.

# Day 2
I finished getting authentication running. I did a little more light styling and found images to be used later. I started working on getting the search information from my form and submitting it to my API.

# Day 3
Finished selecting what API data I wanted to keep and work with. Started working on saving products to the vanity.

# Day 4
Got products to save to the products table and started working on displaying products in the vanity and deleting products that are no longer wanted.

# Technologies Used

* Express
* Node.js
* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap

# Bumps in the Road

I struggled a lot with the Node/Express concepts. Working my recently developed skills into it was difficult for me. I found a lot of the things that I had done before couldn't be implemented in the same ways.

# Next Steps
*Create favorite deleting functionality
*Create product name search functionality
*Style
*Use second API to allow for searches by barcode
